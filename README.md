# BLOOD-CELL-CLASSIFICATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
White Blood Cells (WBCs) play a crucial role in the immune system, defending the body against infections and diseases. Accurate classification of WBCs is essential for diagnosing hematological disorders, immune system deficiencies, and infections. Traditional methods of WBC classification rely on manual microscopic examination, which is time- consuming, requires expert knowledge, and is prone to human error. This project, titled “Determination of WBC Blood Cell Using Image Processing”, aims to automate WBC classification using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in medical diagnostics. This system leverages image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, segmentation, and morphological operations to enhance blood smear images for analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are implemented for feature extraction and classification, enabling precise identification of different WBC subtypes, including Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils. By analyzing key morphological characteristics of WBCs, the system efficiently classifies them, reducing dependency on manual identification.
